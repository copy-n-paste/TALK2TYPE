MIT License – because freedom is beautiful.

You can:
- Use it ✅  
- Modify it ✅  
- Share it ✅  
- Summon it at 3AM to write your emails ✅

You cannot:
- Sue me if it types something dumb 🙅  
- Blame me if it calls your boss “bro” 🙅  
- Turn it into an evil AI overlord (unless it’s funny) 🤖

Seriously though, it's MIT. Do whatever you want. Just don’t be evil.
