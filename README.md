## GeminiGPT – The Voice Assistant Who Talks, Types, and Sometimes Thinks Too Hard

Welcome to **GeminiGPT**, the AI-powered assistant that listens to you, talks back, does your math homework, and even types love letters you’re too shy to send.

Whether you’re a productivity freak or just lonely at 2 AM and need someone to say, “the capital of France is Paris,” this assistant's got you covered.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Voice Recognition That Actually Works**  
Talk to your assistant like it’s 2001 and you're in a sci-fi movie.

✅ **Smart Responses Powered by Gemini**  
It remembers what you said, asks for clarification when you mumble, and won’t ghost you (unlike your ex).

✅ **Time & Location Awareness**  
Knows your local time and where you are (roughly). It’s not stalking... it’s just well-informed.

✅ **Types Stuff for You**  
Say “write this” and it becomes your ghostwriter. Literally. It types while you sip chai.

✅ **Math That Won’t Fail You**  
From basic arithmetic to “what’s 57 times 3.14159?” — this assistant does math faster than your cousin in IIT.

✅ **Memory That’s Just the Right Amount of Creepy**  
Remembers your unfinished thoughts so it can bug you about them later like a nosy neighbor.

## 📦 Future Features (lol maybe)

* Emotion detection: So it knows when you’re sad, confused, or just hungry.
* Local fallback AI for offline mode (aka “when your Wi-Fi dies”)
* A sarcasm toggle. Because not everyone can handle the sass.
* An “annoying little brother” mode that keeps interrupting you.
